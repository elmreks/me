# COMMON GROUND

Intent alignment before action.

COMMON GROUND is an exploration of how humans and AI can work together
to reduce ambiguity, prevent conflict, and create shared understanding
*before* work begins.

This project focuses on:
- intent clarification
- reflection and confirmation
- compression to reduce cognitive load
- keeping humans in control

The live thinking artifact lives here:

Built by a 25+ year carpenter and real-world builder exploring how AI
can help people focus, align, and get shit done fairly.

Status: early, intentional, evolving.
