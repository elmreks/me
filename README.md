# COMMON GROUND

Intent alignment before action.

COMMON GROUND explores how humans and AI can work together to reduce
ambiguity, prevent conflict, and create shared understanding before
work begins.

This project focuses on:
- clarifying intent
- reflecting clearly back to humans
- reducing cognitive load through compression
- keeping humans in control of decisions

The live thinking artifact lives here:

Built by a 25+ year carpenter and real-world builder exploring how AI
can help people focus, align, and get shit done fairly.

Status: early, intentional, evolving.
