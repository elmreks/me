# COMMON GROUND

Intent alignment before action.

COMMON GROUND is an exploration of how humans and AI can work together
to reduce ambiguity, prevent conflict, and create shared understanding
*before* work begins.

This project focuses on:
- clarifying human intent
- reflecting it back in clear language
- reducing cognitive load through compression
- keeping humans in control of decisions

The live thinking artifact is live here:

Built by a 25+ year carpenter and real-world builder exploring how AI
can help people focus, align, and get shit done fairly.

Status: early, intentional, evolving.
