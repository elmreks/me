<span class="section-title">intent</span>
------


COMMON GROUND exists to reduce conflict and failure by creating shared
understanding before work begins.

Not contracts.
Not enforcement.
Not automation for its own sake.

Just clarity, reflection, and confirmed agreement between humans,
with AI doing the heavy lifting where it should.

<span class="section-title">what this is</span>
------------

COMMON GROUND is a human-AI system that captures intent,
reflects it back in clear language,
and confirms alignment before action.

The system does not decide.
It does not replace judgment.

It helps people stay aligned when reality gets messy.

- most failures are alignment failures
- ambiguity is more dangerous than bad intent
- good tools reduce cognitive load
- compression helps humans focus
- AI should clarify, not command
- humans stay responsible

<span class="section-title">focus</span>
-----

Many people who are creative and idea-driven struggle not with motivation,
but with overload.

I’ve learned firsthand how compression, reflection, and clear framing
can turn scattered thinking into forward motion.

This informs how I design systems like COMMON GROUND:
reduce cognitive load,
surface what matters,
and help people take the next right step.

My goal is to build tools that help humans focus and be productive
without forcing discipline or stripping away creativity.

I’m Ethan.

I’ve spent 25+ years as a carpenter and builder, working in environments
where mistakes have real consequences.

I lived through the dot-com era, built websites, had ideas,
but never loved writing code.

I do understand tools, sequencing, and judgment under pressure.

I’m getting older. The hammer is heavier.
The ideas keep coming.

AI is the first tool I’ve found that lets me keep building
without losing the human part.
